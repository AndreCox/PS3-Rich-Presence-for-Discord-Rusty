# PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord-Rusty

This project is a remake of the awesome [PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord](https://github.com/zorua98741/PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord) by [zorua98741](https://github.com/zorua98741)

I wanted to try to make the original script faster and less expensive on resources. Right now the release build uses only 5MB of RAM! Also there is no need to have a Python interpreter running in the background anymore as the new program is standalone.

Discord Rich Presence script for PS3 consoles on HFW&HEN or CFW.

Display what you are playing on your PS3 via Discord's game activity.

## Display Example

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>XMB</th>
		<th> <img src="https://github.com/zorua98741/PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord/blob/main/img/xmb.png?raw=true"> </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>PS3</th>
		<th> <img src="https://github.com/zorua98741/PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord/blob/main/img/ps3.png?raw=true"> </th>
	</tr>
</table>

## Limitations

- **There is still features missing from the original script, I haven't added retro game support yet and there is no config file for customization**

- **A PC must be used to display presence, there is no way to install and use this script solely on the PS3**
- The script relies on webmanMOD, and a major change to it will break this script, please message me about updated versions of webman so that i can test the script with them
